b. Normative
c. Fiscal
d. Monetary

###Response
Answer: A","Here's a brief background knowledge paragraph that explains why physics can be considered a positive science:

In the philosophy of science, sciences are often categorized into different types based on their goals and approaches. The distinction between positive and normative sciences is one such classification. Positive sciences aim to describe or predict the natural world as it exists, using empirical evidence and observation. In contrast, normative sciences focus on prescribing rules or norms for human behavior, rather than describing the natural world. Physics, being a natural science that seeks to understand the fundamental laws and principles governing the physical universe through experimentation and observation, can be considered a positive science. This classification aligns with the scientific method's emphasis on empirical evidence and testability, which are key characteristics of positive sciences.",

b. Unlimited wants and scarce resources
c. Unending wants and limited people
d. Consumption and production

###Response
Answer: B","Here's the background knowledge required to answer this question:

Economics is a social science that studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating limited resources (such as money, time, and materials) among various alternatives. A fundamental concept in economics is scarcity, which refers to the inability to satisfy all wants and needs simultaneously due to limited resources. This concept is closely related to human behavior, specifically how people respond to scarcity by making choices that reflect their preferences, values, and priorities. Therefore, economics examines human behavior as a relationship between unlimited wants (the desires and needs of individuals) and scarce resources (the limited availability of resources).",

One of the key characteristics of resources is that they can serve multiple purposes, also known as alternative uses. This means that a single resource can have various functions or applications, such as a forest serving as both a source of timber and habitat for wildlife. Understanding this concept is essential in managing resources effectively, as it recognizes that resources are not limited to one specific use.",

In economics, the decision of how much to work is a fundamental concept that involves weighing the benefits of labor against other aspects of life.

Work refers to the time spent on earning income through employment or entrepreneurship, while leisure refers to the time devoted to personal activities, hobbies, relaxation, and enjoyment. This trade-off arises because working more hours can lead to higher earnings, but also means less time available for leisure activities, personal relationships, and other important aspects of life.",

The short-run Phillips curve is characterized by a negative slope, indicating that as unemployment falls, inflation rises, and vice versa. This negative slope is due to the trade-off concept between inflation and unemployment that was introduced by Alban William Phillips in his 1958 paper ""Stagflation: The Short-Run Trade-Off Between Inflation and Unemployment"". Therefore, in the short run, the Phillips curve has a negative slope.",
